# Life expectancy and GDP Analysis
### Codecademy Project
**Course:** [Visualize Data with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/visualize-data-with-python)

### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the information about Life Expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 6 countries between the years of 2000 and 2015.

With these information, we'll be able to:

- Identify the correlation between the given variables;
- Understand the evolution of Life Expectancy and GDP over the years for each country; and
- Compare the given variables between countries.

### File Descriptions

- all_data.csv - dataset about life expectancy and GDP of six countries from 2000 to 2015
- life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb - a notebook demonstrating how data analyzed and visualized

### Dataset
The dataset provided has the following columns of data:

- **Country** - nation
- **Year** - the year for the observation
- **Life expectancy at birth (years)** - life expectancy value in years
- **GDP** - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars

### Analysis

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
